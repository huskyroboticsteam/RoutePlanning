UNIX/Linux case :

make
su
make install

A small static library (libkalman.a) will be installed in /usr/local/lib. A 
directory named 'kalman' containing all necessary include files will be 
installed in /usr/local/include. If you wish to install elsewhere, please 
modify the top variables in 'makefile'.

Windows case :

A Visual Studio project has been created to compile the library. To use the 
library, you must add a linked library (the .lib) and an include path (root 
of kalman folder).
