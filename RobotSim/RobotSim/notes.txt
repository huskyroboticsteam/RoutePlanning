Path-splitting algorithm:

1. place two nodes as "safeties" around each endpoint
X                            X
^   ----------------------   ^
X                            X
               R
2. remove BOTH failed safeties
3. unmark visited nodes if fail to add BOTH endpoints
4. renamed visited nodes to processed nodes or something
