Path-splitting algorithm:

1. place two nodes as "safeties" around each endpoint
X                            X
^   ----------------------   ^
X                            X
               R
2. remove BOTH failed safeties
3. unmark visited nodes if fail to add BOTH endpoints
4. renamed visited nodes to processed nodes or something

TODOs
* to prevent bot from getting stuck at a point, either increase tolerance or "smoothen" two edges
by merging them if they can be merged.
* if there is no path at all (no node), gradually decrease bot width until one can be found.
  this avoids from getting stuck but could potentially make bot run into things (not likely for 
  conservatively-picked values)
